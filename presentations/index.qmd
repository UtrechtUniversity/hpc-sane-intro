# Secure Analysis Environment (SANE) {data-background-color="#FFCD00"}
::: {style="text-align: left; margin-left: 2em"}

Working with sensitive data on SURF ResearchCloud.
:::

## Before we start...

Make sure that...

- you've accepted the SRAM invite
- you have a Remote Desktop (RDP) client installed

## Program

- What is ResearchCloud?
- What is SANE?
- Practice: creating SANE analysis workspaces
- Practice: data management and analysis 
- Bonus: working with data on Yoda using iBridges
- Bonus: creating SANE setup

## What is ResearchCloud?
::: {style="text-align: left; margin-top: 2em"}

On-demand cloud resources (compute & storage) in a user-friendly platform.

- Easy collaboration in and across institutions.
- Special applications, customizable environments.
- Deploy on different cloud infrastructures.

:::


## ResearchCloud
::: {style="text-align: left; margin-top: 2em"}
Run VMs (*workspaces*) preconfigured for many different research needs:

- Programming and analysis (e.g. R-Studio, Jupyter, Matlab).
- Analysis tools (e.g. ASReview, 4CAT).
- Field-specific software (e.g. GIS).
- Webservices (e.g. Galaxy).
- ...or simply your own desktop or commandline machine in the cloud.
:::

## SANE
::: {style="text-align: left; margin-top: 2em"}
SANE is a ResearchCloud environment tailored for working with sensitive data.

- Data Provider vs Researcher
  * Data sharing agreement should be in place.
- Customizability of workspaces has been curtailed. Researchers' workspaces do not have internet access once they have been created.
- SANE environments have been especially tested for vulnerabilities (pen tested).

:::

## SANE
::: {style="text-align: left; margin-top: 2em"}
SANE is a severely *restricted* ResearchCloud environment tailored for working with sensitive data.

- Tinker SANE
  * Data cannot leave researcher's workspace
- Blind SANE
  * Data does not even enter researchers' workspace

:::

## Tinker SANE
::: {style="text-align: left; margin-top: 2em"}
Workflow:

1. Dataprovider uploads data.
1. Researcher starts analysis workspace (*data is accessible!*)
1. Researcher performs analyses.
1. Researcher saves results.
1. Dataprovider verifies results, ensures they contain no sensitive data.
1. Dataprovider exports the results, shares with researcher.

## ResearchCloud Terminology
::: {style="text-align: left; margin-top: 2em"}

- Workspace
- Catalog items
- Storage unit
- Collaboration
  * Groups

:::

## Collaborations

[SRAM](https://sram.surf.nl/):

- You control who you invite
- Admins can assign users to different *groups*:
  - *src_co_wallet*
  - *src_co_admin*
  - *src_co_developer*

For this tutorial, some of you are assigned to the `src_co_admin` group. Log in to [SRAM](https://sram.surf.nl/) and note your assigned groups.

## ResearchCloud Portal

Everyone in the same  *Collaboration* can *see* each other's *workspaces*. Note the workspaces you see:

- SANE Data Provider Portal
- SANE Data Server
- SANE Tinker UU Windows

In order to login, setup your ResearchCloud [time-based password](https://servicedesk.surf.nl/wiki/spaces/WIKI/pages/9798290/Log+in+to+your+workspace#Logintoyourworkspace-WorkspaceAccesswithTOTP).

## ResearchCloud Portal

Try logging in to each of the workspaces you see:

- SANE Tinker UU Windows
  * [Login using your Remote Desktop client](https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/vre-docs/docs/first-steps.html#remote-desktop-protocol)
- SANE Data Provider Portal
  * Login by clicking the yellow 'Access' button
- SANE File Server
  * ? Can you login?

## Creating SANE analysis workspace

- Click 'Create New' in the portal
- Select the SANE CO
- Select the *SANE Tinker UU Windows* Catalog Item
- Select the private network
- Continue

**NOTE: creating this workspaces will take > 40 mins**

## Data Provider: upload data

Access the SANE Data Provider Portal and upload a file to the directory `This PC\sane-data\source`.

You can use the example input files from [this repository](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/src-python-example.git).

Upload the file `data/input_data/osm_roads.shp` from that repository.

## Researcher: analysis

Files made available by the dataprovider will be accessible in `This PC\sane-data\source`.

**NOTE: all researchers can see all files in `This PC\sane-data\`!**

- Check that you can open the files.
- If you want, you can run a simple 'analysis' on them using Jupyter Notebooks
  * see next slide

## Researcher: analysis

- Open the Jupyter notebook in the `sane-data/scripts` folder, have a look at the code.
- Run the code
- Copy the results file from your home directory to the `sane-data/results` directory

## Data provider: download results

Once the researcher is finished, you should be able to find and download the results.

## Researcher: analysis

What if we try a more 'real' example? Add and run the following code to your notebook:

```python
import geopandas as gpd

# Read file using gpd.read_file()
data = gpd.read_file(fp)
```

...what happens?

## Researcher: analysis

Oops! The `geopandas` package is not available. You can see the available packages [here](https://gitlab.com/rsc-surf-nl/co-create-plugins/sane-tinker-python-packages/-/raw/main/requirements.txt).

What if we try to install the needed package?

Run the following command in your notebook and observe:

`pip install geopandas`

## Bonus: data transfer from Yoda

What if we don't want to upload/download data to/from the Data Provider Portal to/from the dataprovider's laptop?

We can fetch the data directly from Yoda!

1. Use `ssh` to login to the SANE Data Provider Portal ([howto](https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/vre-docs/docs/first-steps.html#ssh)).
1. `sudo apt install pipx` (press `Y` and enter)
1. `pipx ensurepath`
1. `pipx install ibridges`
1. Verify: `ibridges --help`
1. [iBridges manual](https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/vre-docs/docs/manuals/ibridges.html)

## Bonus: tinker SANE setup

Let's delete all existing SANE workspaces and re-create the setup!
